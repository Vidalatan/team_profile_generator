# Team Profile Generator

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description
<!-- Here you should enter a little about your project. -->

An application to allow the user to generate a quick team profile page in html. This project utilizes [Inquirer](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/), [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest), as well as my own [README Maker](https://github.com/Vidalatan/readme_maker). The application creates a nice looking team profile page that will display some information based on what the user's inputs. Currently, it asks for employee name, id, email, and depending on their role office number, github username, or attending school. The email populates with a clickable link that will open your default electonic mailing application with the team member's email in the 'To' section. The github username will also populate as a link to that github profile.

This application is primarily meant to be a display of the ability to dynamically generate a nice looking HTML page based on user inputs.
